<p>In this chapter I will guide you through a tedious and error prone step in the process of adopting plaintext software: installing all the bits and pieces that we are going to be using. When you use something like Word to write, all you need is Word, but the workflow we are going to be using relies upon different pieces of software that all work together. The good thing about this process is that you only have to do it once, and you won&rsquo;t have to fiddle around with it endlessly. <strong>NOTE</strong>: For Windows users the process is slightly different for different software. See Chapter \ref{windows-supplement} at the end of this book for some supplemental instructions.</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#hahahugoshortcode12s0hbhb">#</a>
</h3>
<p>LaTeX, typically pronounced <em>lay</em>-tek or <em>lah</em>-tex, is a program for typesetting documents developed in the late 70s. It allows you to create really pretty documents and in particular, documents that include mathematical notation, figures, and tables. It can be used to typeset pretty much anything that needs typesetting.</p>
<p>LaTeX is a pretty big program (around 5GBs) so you will need sufficient space on your hard drive to accommodate it. Depending on your system you will need to navigate to the 
  <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions">install page</a> and pick the version that is appropriate for your OS. Follow the installation instructions as you would any other program. This takes a little time due to its size.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc">
  <code>pandoc</code>
  <a class="anchor" href="#pandoc">#</a>
</h3>
<p><code>pandoc</code> bills itself as a &ldquo;universal document converter&rdquo; and can be used to convert files into different formats. It was primarily developed to take documents written in 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"><code>Markdown</code></a> and convert them into other, prettier formats. When combined with LaTeX, <code>pandoc</code> is a pretty powerful tool and we can use it to write in <code>Markdown</code> and then simultaneously convert that document into Word, PDF, Tex and HTML. It is this software that allows you to integrate your work with your colleagues that might not want to make the shift to a plain text workflow. Further, you can actually take in documents in a common format like Word and convert them to plain text.</p>
<p>Just like for LaTeX above, navigate to the 
  <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">install page</a>, and download the installer appropriate to your OS. <code>pandoc</code> is significantly smaller than LaTeX so you should not have an issue installing it.</p>
<h3 id="git-and-github">
  <code>Git</code> and Github
  <a class="anchor" href="#git-and-github">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Git is a version control system which monitors a directory for changes. Think of it as the &ldquo;Track Changes&rdquo; option for a Word Document, but it tracks all the changes that occur to a group of files in a directory. Git is a program with a command line user interface so you will need to know your way around a terminal to use it. It also allows you to take advantage of open source software freely available on 
  <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub is a website that hosts repositories of software, and if you sign up for a free account, acts like a cloud backup for your projects when they are in plaintext. All the software hosted on GitHub can be installed using <code>git</code>, and we will use it to install the templates we are going to be using for our documents. Install <code>Git</code> 
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>.</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#cross-referencing-and-text-editors">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You will likely be mounting an argument or writing in an area of your discipline that requires you reference past works. So you will need a bibliography, and you will probably want to include tables, figures and diagrams that you will reference in the body of your text. It is a pain having to format a bibliography yourself or to number each table and figure. What more, it is particularly annoying when you decide to rearrange your paper and then have to rearrange the number of all the tables and figures in the text. You wll also want a nice interface to actually write and code in.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc-xnos">
  pandoc-xnos
  <a class="anchor" href="#pandoc-xnos">#</a>
</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos"><code>pandoc-xnos</code></a> is for cross-referencing figures, tables, equations, sections and pretty much anything else that can be written in a Markdown file. This helps for automatically handling the labelling of different parts of your document, so you can move the position of a figure or table or equations without having to change the reference to it in the body of your text. Install with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>pip install pandoc-fignos pandoc-eqnos pandoc-tablenos <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>            pandoc-secnos --user
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you get an error that <code>pip</code> can&rsquo;t be found, make sure you have python installed on your computer, which should be the case for macOS and Linux users. You then use this suite of helper functions in documents with some conventions that we will cover in Chapter @sec:usage.</p>
<h3 id="visual-studio-code">
  Visual Studio Code
  <a class="anchor" href="#visual-studio-code">#</a>
</h3>
<p>One of the advantages of plain text is that you can open your files on any computer with the native programs installed on it from the factory. Every computer will have a basic text editor (macOS has TextEdit and Windows has Notepad) and you could do everything we are going to do in this working group with the command line and one of these text editors (in fact you could do everything just with the command line). I <em>highly</em> recommend you install a more advanced text editor to do your work in.</p>
<p>There are a few excellent options to choose from including Sublime Text, Emacs, Atom, Notepad++ and RStudio. By far the best, and the one I use is Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio Code (or VS Code for short). The advantage to using a text editor regardless of which specific one you choose is that they highlight the syntax of whatever programming language you are writing in (including Markdown and LaTeX) enhancing the readability of your code to help writing and debugging. What more, you can typically run everything directly in the text editor so you never need to navigate away from a single window to get all your work done. You can run <code>R</code>, <code>python</code>, and keep your \LaTeX document open all at the same time toggling between the different tasks as you need.</p>
<p>You should install VS Code as it is what I will be using to demonstrate how to use these plain text tools. You can install it from 
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>. One of the nice things about VS Code is that it is 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility"><em>extensible</em></a> and has all sorts of extra features designed and implemented by users to help you get things done. One of the most important extensions is a LaTeX helper that we will be using when we do have to edit or write in LaTeX. After you install VS Code go ahead and install the extension 
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop">here</a>. There are also other helpful things for writing like a 
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">spell checker</a>, a tool for auto-completing 
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=notZaki.pandocciter">citations</a>, a word 
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wordcount">counter</a>, and support for your favorite (or not so favorite) 
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r">statistical software</a>. And don&rsquo;t worry, installing these extensions is just a matter of clicking a button.</p>
<h2 id="sec:macos_path">
  Adding to PATH
  <a class="anchor" href="#sec:macos_path">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of the work of typesetting is going to be taking place in the terminal and sometimes you will get an annoying an inexplicable error like &ldquo;this software is not on the PATH&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find this software&rdquo;, which means that your computer is searching the location where executable programs are located (the PATH variable) but it is not finding whatever software you are telling it to run. Why this happens is a mystery. Sometimes the software has installed onto your computer, but the terminal program doesn&rsquo;t know where to look for where the programs are installed. I know this is a little confusing but here is a quick lesson. When you invoke a command on the terminal the first thing the computer does is check an index of the available software, which it does by examining what is called the PATH variable. If it finds whatever you are asking it to use like <code>pandoc</code> or LaTeX or R or python or whatever, it runs the command. If it doesn&rsquo;t find what you tell it to look for it returns an error.</p>
<p>Before giving up completely try updating the PATH variable so the terminal knows where the software is. Depending on what specific command line or terminal you are using the instructions are slightly different but they will be pretty portable across platforms, and operating systems. This is one of those things that you really only have to learn once and then you&rsquo;ll be able to improvise a lot better later. To find out where the files for a program are on macOS, run the <code>which</code> command followed by what your looking for, such as <code>which pandoc</code>, and it will print the path to where the executables of these files are installed. Sometimes the data files for a program get installed onto our computer without the PATH variable getting updated to tell the terminal that the software is installed.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of terminals on macOS. Run this line of code in your terminal and it will tell you which terminal you are using: <code>echo $0</code>. Check below for relevant information about how to add to the path:</p>
<h3 id="zsh">
  <code>zsh</code>
  <a class="anchor" href="#zsh">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To add a directory to your path in zsh:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>path+=('/path/to/dir')</code> in an open terminal where the path is to where the executables for the program are. For me <code>pandoc</code> is located in <code>/usr/local/bin/pandoc</code> and LaTeX is in <code>/Library/TeX/texbin/latex</code>.</li>
<li>Then run <code>export PATH</code> in the same terminal.</li>
<li>Restart the terminal and check that it works by typing in <code>latex --version</code> or <code>pandoc --version</code> or whatever else was giving you trouble.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bash">
  <code>bash</code>
  <a class="anchor" href="#bash">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Remember when we learned how to use <code>vim</code> from the command line and what a hidden file was? Well now that knowledge will actually come in handy.^[If you are unfamiliar with <code>vim</code> and hidden files, refer to the session 1 documentation, &ldquo;Project Organization and the Terminal&rdquo;.] To add something to the PATH in <code>bash</code> you need to edit your <code>.bash_profile</code> which is located in your home directory. The home directory is where your terminal opens up and is located at <code>/Users/your-user-name</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>.bash_profile</code> file in your home directory (for example,
<code>/Users/your-user-name/.bash_profile</code>) in <code>vim</code> by running <code>vim .bas_profile</code> in your home directory in a terminal.</li>
<li>Add <code>export PATH=&quot;your-dir:$PATH&quot;</code> to the last line of the file, where
<em>your-dir</em> is the directory you want to add.</li>
<li>Save the <code>.bash_profile</code> file by exiting <code>vim</code> with <code>:wq</code>.</li>
<li>Restart your terminal.</li>
</ol>

  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You have actually just done a lot of the work of getting started using plain text for your research and writing. This is an onerous task and you should be commended for your effort. If you have managed to get this far then you are likely somewhat invested in adopting the plain text paradigm but if this effort has inspired skepticism or reticence about diving deeper I think it is important to note that installing the software is something that you only have to do once on any given computer. So you won&rsquo;t have to endlessly tinker with things. Once these tools are installed they are very dependable</p>
